# Movie rating React Application

## About testing web app with Jest & RTL

### Introduction

A simple web app, rating movie connected with a `python` api, allowing us to **Create, Read, Update & Delete** some movies in a simple way and rating them too.

The app's purpose is all about testing React Applications with the frameworks Jest and the React Testing Library.

### Getting Started

1. **The app** `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

- **clone or download the repo** at `https://github.com/CodeIsaMystic/react-testing`
- **on the terminal hit the command`$ cd apps/rates-movie/app`**
- **install dependencies** on`node_modules`with the command`$ npm install`
- **finally run the script `$ npm start`** to launch the app

2. **The api** `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

_You definitively need to have python3 installed on your machine_

- **on another terminal point to the api folder and hit the command `$ cd rates-movie-api`**
- **launch python and some environment's tools by the command `$ python3 -m venv venv`**

- **activating...**
  - windows: `$ venv\Scripts\activate`
  - unix: `$ source venv/bin/activate`
- **install some packages `$ pip install django djangorestframework django-cors-headers`**

- **launching the api `$ python3 manage.py runserver`**

**NOTE:**

Runnig both applications, you could launch the app on your local machine.
_But You do not need the api runnning to test the app, the main purpose of this work..._

### Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

- **`npm start`** Runs the app in the development mode.

- **`npm test`** Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

- **`npm build`** Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

- **`npm eject`** If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
