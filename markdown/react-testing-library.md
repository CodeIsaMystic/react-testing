## Introduction about testing

Writing tests should not be complicated so, **_"Always Keep Things Simple!!"_**

**It only need to code clean and organized as much as possible** and it should allowing for us to test in a simplifying way.

**Combining Unit Test with Snapshots on React should do the job!**

<br>

**So, in summary:**

- coding clean, pure functions
- organizing files architecture
- trying to be sure of what we render (shallowing, units tests)
- making some snapshots ( updating, checking... )
- using code coverage

<br>
<br>

## Unit Tests

### Jest, "the test runner"

**Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework** with a focus on simplicity.
This framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase.
It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly.

By ensuring your tests have unique global state, **Jest can reliably run tests in parallel**.
To make things quick, **Jest runs previously failed tests first** and re-organizes runs based on how long test files take.

**Generate code coverage by adding the flag --coverage**.
No additional setup needed. Jest can collect code coverage information from entire projects, including untested files.

Jest uses a custom resolver for imports in your tests, making it simple to mock any object outside of your testâ€™s scope.
You can **use mocked imports with the rich Mock Functions API to spy on function calls** with readable test syntax.

### React Testing Library by KCD

The `React Testing Library` is a very light-weight solution for testing React components.
**It provides light utility functions on top of `react-dom` and `react-dom/test-utils`** , in a way that encourages better testing practices.

Its primary guiding principle is:

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.

<br>
<br>
<br>

**The React Testing Library created by Kent C. Dodds**, is a testing library known as "opinionated".
Made initially for Reactjs, this library gives **a specific approach** to make and think our tests.
It lets us **test our software the way the users use it**.
It provides a virtual DOM, and lets us find some elements...

<br>
<br>

The react testing library **provides a virtual DOM just for testing, and combine with Jest** to code some suites tests,
run them and determines whether it pass or fail.

<br>
<br>
<br>

#### What is not `react-testing-library`:

1. A test runner or framework
2. Specific to a testing framework (though we recommend Jest as our preference, the library works with any framework. See Using Without Jest)

> NOTE: This library is built on top of [DOM Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/intro/) which is where most of the logic behind the queries is.
